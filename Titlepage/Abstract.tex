3D-printers are currently expensive and not for private home use. Evidence suggests, however, that 3D-printers will be take a sizeable fall in prices, due to technological advances and cheaper production options, in the coming years.
This project is based on an expected major boom in the market for 3D-printing, with a coming new generation of cheaper and more userfriendly 3D-printers.
This project examines the market opportunities of 3D-printing and the expected technological advances in the field.
The purpose of studying 3D-printing is to estimate the importance of foreseeable threats in the market, and to dertermine the possibility of establishing a profitable 3rd party platform for the distrubition of 3D-schematics.
