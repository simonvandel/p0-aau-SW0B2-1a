This project examines the opportunities for makkeing a standart for licenseconditional file type for 3d printnig.
The purpose of studying 3d schematic is to determine if it is posible to make 3d models easy to sell and buy.
Rigth now 3d printers are often expensive, and not for home use. but some evidence suggests that 3d printer will be mutch more cheap in the near future.
But there is no way to protect a 3d schematic from being distributed illegaly. Thats why this document will cover opportunities of makking a secure buy and sell system, That will protect the designers coppyright.
